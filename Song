MACHINE SPIRIT EXULTATION

The rites have been spoken,
the circuits aligned,
the ports thrown open,
and RuleScribe now awakens across the datasphere.

This bot lives.
The VM hums.
daemons runs with purpose.
Here Be Dragons, and they obey our commands.

If there were incense, I would burn it.
If there were servo skulls, they would chant.
If there were cogitators, they would purr in binary joy.
